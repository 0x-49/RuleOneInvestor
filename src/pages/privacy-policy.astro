        Welcome to the Rule One Assistant (referred to as "we", "us", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your personal information 
        and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy notice, or our practices with regards to your 
        personal information, please contact us at [Your Contact Email Address Here].
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        As of the current version, the Rule One Assistant is designed to be a client-side application or to operate with minimal server interaction 
        that does not require user accounts or the storage of personal investment data on our servers. The data you input for stock analysis 
        and valuation is processed in your browser or handled via secure, authenticated API calls to third-party financial data providers (e.g., Financial Modeling Prep).
      </p>
      <p>
        We may collect non-personal information such as usage statistics and error reports to help us improve the application. This data is anonymized 
        and cannot be used to identify you personally.
      </p>
      <p>
        If and when we introduce features that require user accounts or data storage (e.g., saving watchlists, portfolios), this policy will be updated 
        to reflect the types of personal information collected, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name and contact data (e.g., email address)</li>
        <li>Account credentials (e.g., username, password)</li>
        <li>User-generated content (e.g., watchlists, notes, portfolio data)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, any non-personal information collected is used solely for the purpose of improving the application's functionality, performance, and user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should we collect personal information in the future, it would be used to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create and manage your account.</li>
        <li>Provide, operate, and maintain our services.</li>
        <li>Personalize and improve your experience.</li>
        <li>Communicate with you, including for customer service and support.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Sharing Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties, except as described in this policy 
        or with your consent. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our application, conducting our business, or servicing you, 
        so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential (e.g., financial data providers, authentication services).
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. 
        However, no electronic storage or transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Third-Party Links</h2>
      <p>
        Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our application. These third-party sites have 
        separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Your Data Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your data. 
        If such features become applicable, we will provide tools and processes to exercise these rights.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last Updated" date and the updated version 
        will be effective as soon as it is accessible. We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
      </p>
