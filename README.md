# Rule One Investor

## Project Overview

Rule One Investor is a web application designed to assist investors in analyzing stocks based on the principles of Rule One Investing, a methodology popularized by Phil Town. The platform provides tools and metrics to evaluate companies, helping users make informed investment decisions aligned with this value investing strategy.

## What the Site Does

The site provides a suite of tools and analyses to help users apply the Rule One Investing framework. Key functionalities include:

- **Stock Search and Selection:** Users can search for and select stocks for analysis.
- **Rule One Metrics Calculation:** The platform calculates key Rule One metrics, such as the "Big Four" (Growth Rate, Return on Equity, Return on Invested Capital, Free Cash Flow), Margin of Safety, and Payback Time.
- **Financial Data Visualization:** Presents financial data through charts and tables to illustrate trends and health of a company's balance sheet.
- **Valuation Tools:** Provides tools to help determine the intrinsic value and fair value of a stock.
- **Comparison Tools:** Allows users to compare different stocks based on Rule One criteria.
- **Watchlist:** Users can create and manage a watchlist of stocks they are interested in.
- **News and Sentiment Analysis:** Integrates relevant news and sentiment data to provide broader market context.
- **Batch Analysis:** Enables analysis of multiple stocks simultaneously.

## What it is About

The project is about empowering individual investors with the tools and information needed to perform thorough fundamental analysis according to the Rule One Investing philosophy. It aims to make complex financial data more accessible and actionable for making sound investment choices.

## Tech Stack

The application is built using a modern web development stack:

- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling and Shadcn UI components.
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express with TypeScript.
- **Database:** Drizzle ORM for database interactions.
- **Build Tool:** Vite (used by Astro).
- **Framework:** Likely Astro (given the project context, although Vite is explicitly present).

## Data Sources

The platform sources financial data from various APIs to provide comprehensive analysis:

- **Alpha Vantage:** Used for historical and real-time stock data, including financial statements and key metrics.
- **Financial Modeling Prep (FMP):** Provides additional financial data and APIs for a broader range of information.
- **Brave Search:** Potentially used for fetching news and other relevant web content.

## List of Sets of Analyses

The site performs several types of analyses, primarily focused on the Rule One Investing methodology:

- **Fundamental Analysis:** Calculation and presentation of key financial metrics (Big Four, etc.).
- **Valuation Analysis:** Determining intrinsic value, fair value, and margin of safety.
- **Financial Health Analysis:** Assessing the strength of a company's balance sheet and cash flow.
- **Growth Rate Analysis:** Evaluating historical and projected growth rates.
- **Dividend Analysis:** Analyzing dividend history and sustainability.
- **Technical Analysis (Basic):** May include basic charting and technical indicators.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Gauging market sentiment around a stock.

## What it Helps People With

This application helps people who want to invest in individual stocks but need a structured approach to evaluate companies. It simplifies the process of gathering and analyzing financial data, making it easier to apply the principles of Rule One Investing to find fundamentally strong companies trading at a discount.

## Why They Would Need This

Investors need this tool because performing thorough fundamental analysis manually can be time-consuming and complex. This platform automates many of the calculations and data visualizations required by the Rule One method, allowing users to focus on understanding the business and making informed decisions. It provides a centralized place for analysis, reducing the need to gather data from disparate sources.

## Style of Investing Analysis Inspired From

The analysis style is directly inspired by **Rule One Investing**, as taught by Phil Town. This is a value investing strategy that focuses on finding wonderful companies trading at an attractive price. It emphasizes understanding the business, identifying key financial metrics that indicate a strong and growing company, and calculating a "margin of safety" before investing.

## More

The project is under active development, with plans to expand features and improve the depth and breadth of analysis available. Contributions and feedback are welcome.
