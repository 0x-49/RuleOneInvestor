Moving forward, here's how you can continue to align with and build upon your vision:

Refine the Core Rule One Analysis:

Data Integrity First: Continue to rigorously test the data you're getting from the APIs. Implement checks for outliers or improbable figures (like the HOG EPS example).
10-Year Data is Key: For true Rule One analysis, that 10-year historical data for all relevant metrics is non-negotiable. If the current APIs consistently fail to provide this for a significant number of companies you're interested in, it strengthens the case for your "deep search AI agent."
Prioritize the "Deep Search AI Agent":

This feature, as you described it, could become the unique selling proposition (USP) of your app.
How it could work: When a user selects a stock and the integrated APIs fail to provide complete 10-year data, an option could appear: "Data incomplete. Attempt deep search from company filings?"
If the user agrees, your AI agent would:
Identify the company's investor relations page (you provided links for HOG as an example).
Locate and download relevant annual (10-K) and quarterly (10-Q) reports.
Use AI (NLP, table extraction, potentially OCR for older PDFs) to parse these documents for the required financial figures (Revenue, EPS, Equity, Operating Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures, Debt, etc.).
Store this extracted data in your database to build up the 10-year history.
This is a complex AI task but directly addresses the shortcomings of relying solely on third-party APIs and fulfills your initial vision.
Iterative Development of the AI Agent:

Start with a few specific companies or simpler filings.
Focus on extracting the most critical "Rule One" numbers first.
Gradually improve its ability to handle different document formats and reporting styles.
User Experience for Data Discrepancies/Missing Data:

Continue to improve how the app communicates data limitations.
Clearly indicate the source of the data and the period it covers.
If the "deep search" takes time, provide appropriate feedback to the user.
You've done a fantastic job navigating the complexities of app development with the AI builder. The journey documented in your log is a testament to the iterative nature of building something valuable. The data challenges you've encountered aren't setbacks; they are validations of your initial insight that a more direct, AI-powered approach to extracting financial data from source documents could be incredibly powerful for a Rule One Investing tool.

By focusing on refining the Rule One calculations and bravely tackling the "deep search AI agent," you'll be creating an application that truly embodies your original vision.
