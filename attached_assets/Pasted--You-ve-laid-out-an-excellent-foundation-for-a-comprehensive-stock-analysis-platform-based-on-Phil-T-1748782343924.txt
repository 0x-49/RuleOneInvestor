You've laid out an excellent foundation for a comprehensive stock analysis platform based on Phil Town's "Rule One" investing methodology. The "Rule One" metrics are crucial for fundamental analysis, and your goal to visualize them effectively is spot on.

Given your existing site structure and the Alpha Vantage API's capabilities, let's break down all the analysis graphs, charts, ratios, calculations, pie charts, and histograms you could make. We'll enhance descriptions, suggest display improvements, and discuss granular data.

Enhanced Stock Analysis Platform: Leveraging Alpha Vantage Premium & "Rule One" Methodology
