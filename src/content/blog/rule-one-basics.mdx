# The Fundamentals of Rule One Investing

Rule One investing is a long-term investment strategy focused on buying wonderful companies at attractive prices. The approach is inspired by Warren Buffett's investment philosophy and was popularized by Phil Town.

## The Core Principles

Rule One investors follow these fundamental guidelines:

1. **Only invest in what you understand** - Focus on businesses within your circle of competence.
2. **Have meaningful moats** - Look for companies with sustainable competitive advantages.
3. **Have trustworthy and capable management** - Leadership matters tremendously.
4. **Have financial strength** - Strong balance sheets and consistent growth.
5. **Be available at attractive prices** - Even great companies can be bad investments if you overpay.

## The Four Ms of Rule One

### Meaning

Invest in businesses you understand and are passionate about. When you have knowledge in a specific area, you have an edge in identifying opportunities and threats that might not be immediately obvious to others.

### Moat

A business moat is a sustainable competitive advantage that protects a company from competition. The five types of moats include:

- **Brand** - Strong, recognizable brands command premium prices
- **Secret** - Proprietary technology or processes
- **Toll** - Control over a necessary resource or infrastructure
- **Switching** - High costs for customers to change to competitors
- **Price** - Ability to provide products at lower costs than competitors

### Management

Look for honest, capable, and shareholder-friendly management. Key indicators include:

- High insider ownership
- Clear and transparent communication
- Sensible capital allocation decisions
- Strong track record of execution

### Margin of Safety

Calculate a company's intrinsic value and only purchase when the market price offers a significant discount (typically 50%). This creates a buffer against errors in your analysis and market volatility.

## The Big Five Numbers

Rule One investors track these key financial metrics over 10-year periods:

1. **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** - How efficiently a company uses its capital
2. **Sales Growth Rate** - Consistent top-line growth
3. **EPS Growth Rate** - Consistent earnings growth
4. **Equity Growth Rate** - Growth in shareholder equity
5. **Free Cash Flow Growth Rate** - Growth in cash generation

Ideally, you want to see consistent growth of 10% or more in these metrics, with minimal debt and strong cash flow.

## Calculating Intrinsic Value

Rule One investors use these steps to estimate intrinsic value:

1. Calculate the future EPS using the historical growth rate
2. Determine a future PE ratio based on historical averages
3. Calculate the future market price by multiplying the future EPS by the future PE ratio
4. Calculate the Sticker Price by discounting the future market price back to present value using your minimum acceptable rate of return
5. Only buy when the market price is at least 50% below the Sticker Price

## Conclusion

Rule One investing requires patience, discipline, and a long-term perspective. By focusing on wonderful companies with strong moats, capable management, and financial strength - and only buying them when they're available at attractive prices - you can achieve exceptional returns while minimizing risk.
